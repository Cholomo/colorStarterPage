# Color Start page
This website is designed as a simple Start page with vanilla CSS and JS
It's designed to show you 3 tabs and a NASA image.
### **_Now tab_**
It's meant to show you the time and weather of where you are.
### **__Links tab__**
Should give you an option to add links and then link you to a website.
### **__Search tab__**
Lets you search on youtube, google and somewhere else.

## Things I still have to add:
- The search tab.
- The weather.
- Make the links pretty.
- Make the NASA Image show on page
- Eventually make it with a framework.
